# JwtNetCore7.0WebApiAuthorization

Hello Everyone,

I would like to share a small project I have developed with you. I built this project using .NET 7.0 and enhanced the application's security by utilizing JSON Web Token (JWT).

Key features of my project include:

🔐 Authentication and Authorization: Using JSON Web Token (JWT), I ensured that users can securely log in and access specific API routes only if they are authorized.

🌐 Web API: The Web API I created with .NET 7.0 provides a robust platform for data exchange.

🚀 Learning Experience: While developing this project, I gained significant experience in tasks such as JWT token creation and user authentication. What I've learned during this project has been invaluable to me.
