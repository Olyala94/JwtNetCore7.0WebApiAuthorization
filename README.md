# JwtNetCore7.0WebApiAuthorization

Hello Everyone,

I'd like to share a small project I've developed with you. I've built this project using .NET 7.0 and bolstered its security by implementing JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.

The code includes an example of JWT token creation and user authentication. I've learned many new things while working on this project.
